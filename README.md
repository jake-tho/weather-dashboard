# weather-dashboard
Note due to this assignment being due during a project i did work on this assignment with John M so our homework is probably going to look similar.
This Weather Dashboard allows you to see a full 5 day forecast for whatever city you enetr in.
It pulls all of the infdormation for the cities using an open weather api.
It allows you to save multiple cities and whenever you enter a city in, it saves it so even if you close your browser it is still there when you revisit the page.
You are also able to clear the cities if you want to.
